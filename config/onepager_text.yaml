    body: >
      This analysis attempts to quantify the expected load-shedding in Ukraine over 
      the winter period 2025/26, accounting for the current state of generation capacities,
      war-adjusted demand, and cross-border transfer limits.

  background:
    title: "Background / motivation"
    body: >
      The re-intensification of Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure over October
      and November 2025 has led to losses in thermal capacities, both to coal and
      combined-heat-and-power (CHP) plants, the latter of which provide essential heating 
      during winter. Reports from aroudn the country indicate that load-shedding is already
      occuring, and is expected to worsen as heating demand peaks in the coldest months. Here we
      provide a model-based estimate of the expected load-shedding and explore potential mitigation
      measures.

  methodology:

    # Bullet points shown in the "Methodology" list
    bullets:
      - "Model: In-house PyPSA (Python for Power Systems Analysis) model at hourly resolution."
      - "Objective: minimise total system cost subject to constraints."
      - "Spatial granularity: 1 node per country, entirety of ENTSO-E modelled"
      - "Hourly dispatch optimised economically over the period November 2025 - March 2026."
      - "Maintenance outages for nuclear units included"
      - "Dummy load shedding generators (very high cost, last in merid order) installed in Ukraine to capture unserved energy."
      - "Demand data: ENTSO-E Transparency Platform; for UA adjusted to reflect war impacts." 
      - "Installed capacities data: Powerplantmatching & Global Energy Monitor; UA capacities estimated by GDU"

      - "Heat Shock: +XX% demand in certain hours to reflect increased electrical heating."


  main_findings:
    title: "Main findings"
    bullets:
      - "Load shedding is required in 41% of hours and sums up to 2.8 TWh." 
      - "The maximum load shedding is about 5.6 GW, representing approx. 34% of the peak load."
      - "Substituting gas and district heating with electric heaters increases demand by 2 TWh mainly in the afternoon and evening hours. Under this assumption, load shedding takes place in 49% of the hours and sum up to 4.1 TWh."
      - "The increase of cross-border capacity has helped, but the following measures would provide even more relief:"
